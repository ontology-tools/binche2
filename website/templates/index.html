<h3>About Selecting Target of Enrichment</h3>
<p>
    <strong>ChEBI structure classification:</strong> The structure classification describes a molecular entity based on its composition and/or the connectivity between its constituent atoms.
    <br>
    <strong>ChEBI role classification:</strong> The role classification describes the role of a molecular entity within a biological context and/or its intended use by humans.
    <br>
    <strong>ChEBI structure and role classification:</strong> The structure and role classification is the union of both classifications. Note that the structure classification is significantly larger than the role classification.
